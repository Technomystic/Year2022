    // Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
    // Output: 1
    // Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
    // Example 2:
    // Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
    // Output: 2
    // Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

    // The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
