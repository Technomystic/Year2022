    // 785. Is Graph Bipartite
    // There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:
    // There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
    // There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
    // If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
    // The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
    // A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.
    // Return true if and only if it is bipartite.
    // Finds if the given graph is bipartite.
    // - Parameter graph: An undirected `graph`.
    // - Returns: True if the given graph is bipartite, otherwise returns false.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
    // Output: false
    // Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
    // Example 2:
    // Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
    // Output: true
    // Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
    // Constraints:
    // graph.length == n
    // 1 <= n <= 100
    // 0 <= graph[u].length < n
    // 0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
    // graph[u] does not contain u.
    // All the values of graph[u] are unique.
    // If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.
    // - Complexity:
    //   - time: O(n + e), where n is the number of nodes in the graph, and e is the number of edges in the graph.
    //   - space: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
