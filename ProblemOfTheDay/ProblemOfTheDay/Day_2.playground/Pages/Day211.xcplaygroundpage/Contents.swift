    // 916. Word Subsets
    // We are given two arrays words1 and words2 of words.  Each word is a string of lowercase letters.
    // Now, say that word b is a subset of word a if every letter in b occurs in a, including multiplicity.  For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior", but is not a subset of "world".
    // Now say a word a from words1 is universal if for every b in words2, b is a subset of a.
    // Return a list of all universal words in words1.  You can return the words in any order.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
    // Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
    // Example 2:
    // Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["l","e"]
    // Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
    // Example 3:
    // Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","oo"]
    // Output: ["facebook","google"]
    // Example 4:
    // Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["lo","eo"]
    // Output: ["google","leetcode"]
    // Example 5:
    // Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["ec","oc","ceo"]
    // Output: ["facebook","leetcode"]
    // Note:
    // 1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 10000
    // 1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10
    // words1[i] and words2[i] consist only of lowercase letters.
    // All words in words1[i] are unique: there isn't i != j with words1[i] == words1[j].
    // Solution: build memoB for recording char accurs in B iteratively check each a to see if a char array cover memoB.

    // - Complexity:
    //   - time: O(B.count + A.count)
    //   - space: O(1), only constant space is used.
