    // 630. Course Schedule III
    // There are n different online courses numbered from 1 to n. You are given an array courses where courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi] indicate that the ith course should be taken continuously for durationi days and must be finished before or on lastDayi.
    // You will start on the 1st day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.
    // Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]
    // Output: 3
    // Explanation:
    // There are totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
    // First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.
    // Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day.
    // Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day.
    // The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.
    // Example 2:
    // Input: courses = [[1,2]]
    // Output: 1
    // Example 3:
    // Input: courses = [[3,2],[4,3]]
    // Output: 0

    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= courses.length <= 10^4
    // 1 <= durationi, lastDayi <= 10^4
