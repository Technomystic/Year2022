    // 376. Wiggle Subsequence
    // A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.
    // For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
    // In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.
    // A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
    // Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.
    // Finds the length of the longest wiggle sequence.
    // - Parameter nums: An integer array.
    // - Returns: The length of the longest wiggle sequence.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
    // Output: 6
    // Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
    // Example 2:
    // Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
    // Output: 7
    // Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
    // One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
    // Example 3:
    // Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    // Output: 2
    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    // 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    // Follow up: Could you solve this in O(n) time?
    // - Complexity:
    //   - time: O(n), where n is the length of nums.
    //   - space: O(1), only constant space is used.
