    // 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
    // Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
    // For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:
    // It is guaranteed that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
    // Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
    // Finds the node at which the two lists intersect.
    // - Parameters:
    //   - headA: Linked list head.
    //   - headB: Linked list head.
    // - Returns: The node at which the two lists intersect.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
    // Output: Intersected at '8'
    // Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
    // From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
    // Example 2:
    // Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
    // Output: Intersected at '2'
    // Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
    // From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
    // Example 3:
    // Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
    // Output: No intersection
    // Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
    // Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
    // Constraints:
    // The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
    // The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
    // 0 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4
    // 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
    // 0 <= skipA <= m
    // 0 <= skipB <= n
    // intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
    // intersectVal == listA[skipA + 1] == listB[skipB + 1] if listA and listB intersect.

    // Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory?
    // - Complexity:
    //   - time: O(n + m), where n is the length of the list A, and m is the length of list B.
    //   - space: O(1), only constant space is used.

    func getIntersectionNode(_ headA: ListNode?, _ headB: ListNode?) -> ListNode? {
        guard headA != nil, headB != nil else { return nil }

        var a: ListNode? = headA
        var b: ListNode? = headB

        while a !== b {
            a = a == nil ? headB : a?.next
            b = b == nil ? headA : b?.next
        }

        return a
