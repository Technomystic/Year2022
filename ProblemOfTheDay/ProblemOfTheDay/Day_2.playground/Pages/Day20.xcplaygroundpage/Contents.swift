    // 875. Koko Eating Bananas
    // Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
    // Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
    // Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
    // Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
    // Output: 4
    // Example 2:
    // Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
    // Output: 30
    // Example 3:
    // Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
    // Output: 23
    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= piles.length <= 10^4
    // piles.length <= h <= 10^9
    // 1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9
