    // 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
    // Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
    // Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
    // Clarification:
    // Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?
    // Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.
    // Internally you can think of this:
    // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
    // int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
    // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
    // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
    // for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    //     print(nums[i]);
    // }
    // Removes the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice.
    // - Parameter nums: A sorted array.
    // - Returns: The new length.

    // Example 1:
    // Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
    // Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
    // Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
    // Example 2:
    // Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
    // Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
    // Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
    // -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
    // nums is sorted in ascending order.
    /// - Complexity:
    ///   - time: O(n), where n is the length of nums.
    ///   - space: O(1), only constant space is used.

    func removeDuplicates(_ nums: inout [Int]) -> Int {
        let n = nums.count
        guard n > 2 else { return n }
        var j = 1
        var count = 1

        for i in 1..<nums.count {
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1] {
                count += 1
            } else {
                count = 1
            }

            if count <= 2 {
                nums[j] = nums[i]
                j += 1
            }
        }

        return j
    }
