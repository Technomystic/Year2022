    // 1192. Critical Connections in a Network
    // There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.
    // A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.
    // Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
    // Output: [[1,3]]
    // Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
    // Constraints:
    // 2 <= n <= 10^5
    // n - 1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
    // 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
    // ai != bi
    // There are no repeated connections.
    // Solution: DFS
    // edge is critical, if and only if it is not in a circle
    // - How to find edge in circle
    //   - use DFS to find cycles and decide whether or not discard them
    //   - define rank of a node: depth of a node during DFS, starting node has rank 0
    //   - only we've started but not finish visiting have ranks, 0 <= rank < n
    //   - if node not visited yet, special rank -2
    //   - if fully completed visit node, special rank n
    // - How can rank help removing circle
    //   - have a current path of length k during a DFS. The nodes on the path has increasing ranks from 0 to kand incrementing by 1. Surprisingly, your next visit finds a node that has a rank of p where 0 <= p < k. Why does it happen? Aha! You found a node that is on the current search path!
    //   - How does the upper level of search knows, if you backtrack? Let's make use of the return value of DFS: dfs function returns the minimum rank it finds. During a step of search from node u to its neighbor v, if dfs(v) returns something smaller than or equal to rank(u), then u knows its neighbor v helped it to find a cycle back to u or u's ancestor. So u knows it should discard the edge (u, v) which is in a cycle.

    // - Complexity:
    //   - time: O(V + E)
    //   - space: O(E)
