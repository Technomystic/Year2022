    // 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique
    // A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.
    // Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.
    // The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: s = "aab"
    // Output: 0
    // Explanation: s is already good.
    // Example 2:
    // Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
    // Output: 2
    // Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
    // Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
    // Example 3:
    // Input: s = "ceabaacb"
    // Output: 2
    // Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
    // Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
    // Constraints:
    // 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    // s contains only lowercase English letters.
