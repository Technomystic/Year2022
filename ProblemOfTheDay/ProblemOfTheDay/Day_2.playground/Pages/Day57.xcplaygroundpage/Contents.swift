    // 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes
    // You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.
    // Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
    // Output: 4
    // Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
    // Example 2:
    // Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
    // Output: 4
    // Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
    // Constraints:
    // n == graph.length
    // 1 <= n <= 12
    // 0 <= graph[i].length < n
    // graph[i] does not contain i.
    // If graph[a] contains b, then graph[b] contains a.
    // The input graph is always connected.
