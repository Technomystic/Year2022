    // 695. Max Area of Island
    // You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
    // The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
    // Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
    // Output: 6
    // Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
    // Example 2:
    // Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
    // Output: 0
    // Constraints:
    // m == grid.length
    // n == grid[i].length
    // 1 <= m, n <= 50
    // grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
