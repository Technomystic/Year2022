    // 1631. Path With Minimum Effort
    // You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.
    // A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
    // Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
    // - Parameter heights: The heights of cells.
    // - Returns: The minimum effort.
    // Example 1:
    // Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
    // Output: 2
    // Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
    // This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
    // Example 2:
    // Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
    // Output: 1
    // Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
    // Example 3:
    // Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
    // Output: 0
    // Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
    // Constraints:
    // rows == heights.length
    // columns == heights[i].length
    // 1 <= rows, columns <= 100
    // 1 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^6
    // - Complexity:
    //   - time: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the matrix height, and m is the number of columns in the matrix height.
    //   - space: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the matrix height, and m is the number of columns in the matrix height.
